\description{
  Estimate the baseline by using Savitzky-Golay Algorithm
}
\usage{
sav.gol(T, fl, forder = 4, dorder = 0)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{T}{ vector of signals to be filtered }
  \item{fl}{ filter length (for instance fl = 51..151) }
  \item{forder}{ filter order (2 = quadratic filter, 4= quartic) }
  \item{dorder}{ derivative order (0 = smoothing, 1 = first derivative, etc.) }
}

\value{
The return is a smoothed vector (baseline).
